# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ";ap"
    replace: "application.properties"
  - trigger: ";le"
    replace: "tx_ledger_entry"
  - trigger: ";ct"
    replace: "commit_timestamp"
  - trigger: ";etl"
    replace: "app-search-etl-beam"
  - trigger: ";epj"
    replace: "app-eventsource-poller-job"
  - trigger: ";email"
    replace: "jduan@highnote.com"
  - trigger: ";kmp"
    replace: "keep me posted"
  - trigger: ";k8s"
    replace: "Kubernetes"
  - trigger: ";pts"
    replace: "Predictive Test Selection"
  - trigger: ";sg"
    replace: "sound good"
  - trigger: ";ty"
    replace: "Thank you!"
  - trigger: ";txn"
    replace: "transaction"
  - trigger: ";card_tran"
    replace: "tx_card_transaction_event"
  - trigger: ";wdyt"
    replace: "What do you think?"
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
