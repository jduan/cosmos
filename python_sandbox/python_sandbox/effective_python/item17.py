# The iterator protocol is how Python for loops and related expressions traverse the contents of a
# container type. When Python sees a statement like for x in foo it will actually call iter(foo).
# The iter built-in function calls the foo.__iter__ special method in turn. The __iter__ method must
# return an iterator object (which itself implements the __next__ special method). Then the for loop
# repeatedly calls the next built-in function on the iterator object until itâ€™s exhausted (and
# raises a StopIteration exception).
#
# It sounds complicated, but practically speaking you can achieve all of this behavior for your
# classes by implementing the __iter__ method as a generator.

    The only downsize of this approach is that it reads the input data multiple times!
