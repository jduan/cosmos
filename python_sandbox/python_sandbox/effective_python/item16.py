# Consider generators instead of returning lists.
# Generators are functions that use yield expressions. When called, generator functions do not
# actually run but instead immediately return an iterator. With each call to the next built-in
# function, the iterator will advance the generator to its next yield expression. Each value
# passed to yield by the generator will be returned by the iterator to the caller.


# Things to Remember
#
# Using generators can be clearer than the alternative of returning lists of accumulated
# results.
#
# The iterator returned by a generator produces the set of values passed to yield expressions
# within the generator functionâ€™s body.
#
# Generators can produce a sequence of outputs for arbitrarily large inputs because their
# working memory doesn't include all inputs and outputs.
