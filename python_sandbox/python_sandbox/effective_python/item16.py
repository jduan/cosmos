"""
Prefer catch-all unpacking over slicing

1. Unpacking assignments may include a starred expression to store all values
that werenâ€™t assigned to the other parts of the unpacking pattern in a list.

2. Starred expressions may appear in any position of the unpacking pattern.
They will always become a list instance containing zero or more values.

3. When dividing a list into non-overlapping pieces, catch-all unpacking is
much less error prone than using separate statements that do slicing and
indexing.
