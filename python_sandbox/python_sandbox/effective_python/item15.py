# Things to Remember
#
# Closure functions can refer to variables from any of the scopes in which they were defined.
#
# By default, closures can’t affect enclosing scopes by assigning variables.
#
# In Python 3, use the nonlocal statement to indicate when a closure can modify a variable in
# its enclosing scopes.
#
# In Python 2, use a mutable value (like a single-item list) to work around the lack of the
# nonlocal statement.
#
# Avoid using nonlocal statements for anything beyond simple functions.
