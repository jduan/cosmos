# Things to Remember
#
# Private attributes aren't rigorously enforced by the Python compiler.
#
# Plan from the beginning to allow subclasses to do more with your internal APIs and attributes
# instead of locking them out by default. Use "protected attributes" in this case.
#
# Use documentation of protected fields to guide subclasses instead of trying to force access
# control with private attributes.
#
# Only consider using private attributes to avoid naming conflicts with subclasses that are out of
# your control.


# The private attribute behavior is implemented with a simple transformation of the attribute name.
# When the Python compiler sees private attribute access in methods like
# MyChildObject.get_private_field, it translates __private_field to access
# _MyChildObject__private_field instead. In this example, __private_field was only defined in
# MyParentObject.__init__, meaning the private attribute’s real name is
# _MyParentObject__private_field. Accessing the parent’s private attribute from the child class
# fails simply because the transformed attribute name doesn’t match.
#
# Knowing this scheme, you can easily access the private attributes of any class, from a subclass or
# externally, without asking for permission.
#
# Why doesn’t the syntax for private attributes actually enforce strict visibility? The simplest
# answer is one often-quoted motto of Python: “We are all consenting adults here.” Python
# programmers believe that the benefits of being open outweigh the downsides of being closed.
#
# protected attributes: _value
# private attributes: __value
